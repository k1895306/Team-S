For mail to work,

 Assuming you are using xampp on windows, locate the “php.ini” file in the directory “C:\xampp\php”. Look for the "[mail function]", comment out the set port and settings and change them to:
SMTP=smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port=587 (your local port, 587 in my case)
sendmail_from = ticketmachineproject@gmail.com
sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"

 
Restart XAMPP
